            Since I was seven I've been obsessed with creating some form of application myself.
            Back then it started with Scratch, creating my own little scenarios and being fascinated by all the possibilities.

            Fast forward two to three years and through some random Youtube tutorial, I started getting in touch with Batch.
            There, one of my first projects was born: my own "Operating System", or atleast, that was my vision of it back then.
            Obviously, a simple console application written in Batch does not qualify as a real operating system,
            but for nine year old me, it absolutely did.
